# Turtlecup 
The idea of this project was to simulate a kind of RoboCup using Turtlebots2. However, it could not be possible to use the Navigation Stack for more than one Turtlebot. Therefore there is just one of them that looks for the ball and shoots, 2 goalkeepers and 2 that work as a VAR, whose only task is to detect whether there was goal or not.
